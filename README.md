Five Steps:

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.
